**Truth In Data Science**

One of Earth's primary ocean circulation systems, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), redistributes heat around the globe and has a significant influence on climate. We use several publicly available proxy records to recreate the history of the AMOC since around AD 400. After a lengthy and generally steady period, the AMOC began to deteriorate in the nineteenth century, followed by a second, more rapid decline in the mid-twentieth century, culminating in the AMOC's weakest condition in recent decades. Climate change poses a threat to the AMOC. As the atmosphere warms owing to rising greenhouse gas levels, the ocean's capacity to dissipate heat from the North Atlantic surface decreases, weakening one of the AMOC's driving mechanisms. The AMOC is continually deteriorating in climate model estimates for this century's global warming. The decrease of the northward heat source will have a cooling effect on the climate in the North Atlantic region. This effect is taken into consideration in climate models, but because the direct warming effect of rising greenhouse gas concentrations is stronger, the net result is still warming over land. However, this project utilized past research works of Caesar et al. (2018), Cheng et al. (2017), Osmann et al. (2019), Rahmstorf et al. (2015), Spooner et al. (2020) and Thornalley et al. (2018), Tsub and discovered the pattern of the AMOC. Our goal is to find the most accurate research work using P-hacking, Bayes Factor and Jags Model Implementation.
